            Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gaurav. I'm a 16-year-old high schooler from New Delhi, India. I work as a community engineer at Hack Club and at CodeDay, where I work to provide welcoming and diverse opportunities for undeserved students to explore a future in tech and beyond.Â 
            <br/><br/>
            Since 2007, I've done a lot of things, from spending my 5 years of life in the snowy mountains to playing in the beautiful hills of Uttarakhand. I find joy in ambiguity and feel more engaged when working on problems that can be solved by mainly exploring the web or reading a book.Â 
            <br/><br/>
            Say Hi! at: <a href='mailto:hi@pandeygaurav.com' className='pink'>hi@pandeygaurav.com</a>
            <br/><br />
            Note: Computers have seriously changed my life. I began coding when I was 12, and since then I've been invited to speak at international conferences in Florence, Salt Lake City, Singapore, Seattle, and London.Â PS: I love Vim, Music, Art and Switzerland.</p>
